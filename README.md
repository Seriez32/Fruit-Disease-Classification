# Fruit-Disease Classification with Vision Transformer
This project implements a binary classification model to detect diseased and healthy fruits using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The model is trained on a dataset of fruit images, leveraging data augmentation, a pre-trained ViT backbone, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
